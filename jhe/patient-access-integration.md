title: Patient Access Integration
---

JHE can pull a patient's clinical data from any **SMART on FHIR** patient-access API
(Epic, Cerner/Oracle Health, Athena, ...) using the **SMART App Launch standalone patient
launch**. Epic's sandbox is the seeded example, but nothing in the client is Epic-specific:
a patient searches for their hospital, picks it, is sent to that hospital's login, and their
records are converted and stored in JHE.

This is the single onboarding doc for the **Patient Access** client: hospital branding,
setup, configuration, and an end-to-end test. The flow is **vendor-agnostic** - only the FHIR
endpoint (`iss`) and brand differ per provider.

## Architecture

Unlike the [OW integration](./ow-integration.md) (a server-side poller), the Patient Access
flow runs **client-side in the browser**: a vanilla-JS page hosted on JHE redeems the
invitation for a JHE token, lets the patient pick their hospital, runs the EHR's PKCE OAuth,
pulls the patient's FHIR data, and writes it back into JHE. The backend serves the pages,
holds the EHR config in `JheClient.aux_data`, searches the hospital-brand tables, converts
each pulled R4 resource to R5, and stores it.

```
Patient browser ─▶ /clients/patient-access/?code=<invitation>   (connect.html)
   ├─ POST /api/v1/invitation/<token>          ─▶ redeem invitation
   ├─ POST /o/token/                           ─▶ JHE access token (PKCE)
   ├─ GET  /api/v1/patient-access/brands?q=    ─▶ hospital search (pick one -> its iss)
   └─ FHIR.oauth2.authorize(iss, clientId, scope, redirectUri)
          │
     EHR login ◀───── login + consent ─────────┘
          │
          ▼
   /clients/patient-access/callback   (callback.html)
       │  FHIR.oauth2.ready()  ─▶ EHR access token + patient id
       ├─ POST /api/v1/patient-access/identifier  ─▶ PatientIdentifier (EHR patient id)
       ├─ POST /api/v1/fhir_sources               ─▶ FhirSource id
       ├─ GET  <EHR>/{Patient,Condition,...}      ─▶ pull each USCDI type (R4)
       └─ POST /fhir-import/R4/{type}             ─▶ convert R4->R5, store as FhirAuxResource
              (header X-JHE-FHIR-Source-ID)          "Conditions: N", "Labs: N", ...
```

The EHR patient id is stored as a `PatientIdentifier` (`system` = the EHR `iss`, `value` =
the EHR patient id). The client pulls the demo USCDI set (Patient demographics, Condition,
MedicationRequest, AllergyIntolerance, lab Observations); each type is fetched and written
independently so one failure does not abort the rest. Because the EHR serves **R4** and JHE
stores **R5**, each resource is POSTed to the [`/fhir-import/R4/` endpoint](./fhir/r4-import.md),
which converts it via the HL7 cross-version maps and then runs the normal create - landing
resources that are not OMH/IEEE-1752-coded Observations in `FhirAuxResource`, linked to a
`FhirSource` the patient registers on the fly.

Every Connect registers a **new** `FhirSource` — a source stores no endpoint and is identified by
its pk, so there is nothing to match a previous run against, and nothing needs one: each source is
its own identifier namespace, so a reconnect re-imports into a fresh namespace rather than
colliding with the earlier one. The authorized server URL is kept in the source's `label`, its only
human-facing handle.

## Hospital branding / selection (SMART App Launch 2.2)

A JHE invitation doesn't say which hospital the patient uses, so the connect page shows a
**search box** first. This implements SMART 2.2 "user-access brands".

- **Data model** (`ehr_brand.py`):
  `EhrBrand` (one per health system: `name`, `vendor`, unique `fhir_base_url` = the SMART
  `iss`, `npi`, `logo_url`) and `EhrBrandLocation` (one per facility: `name`, `address_text`,
  `city`, `state`, `postal_code`, FK to brand). Vendor-neutral by design - no Epic-only columns.
- **Which facility the patient picked** is recorded on the `FhirSource` as a nullable
  `ehr_brand_location` FK. It is **descriptive only**: every location of a brand shares one
  `fhir_base_url`, so the connection itself cannot tell facilities apart — the field records the
  patient's selection, not where the data came from, and must not be read as provenance. It is
  null for a source that is not a supported EHR at a supported location. The picked id is held in
  `sessionStorage` across the SMART redirect, because the server cannot re-derive it (an `iss`
  identifies a brand, and a brand has many locations).
- **Search API**: `GET /api/v1/patient-access/brands?q=&state=&postal=` (authenticated). `q`
  matches facility name, city, or brand name. Returns facilities with their `id` and the brand's
  `fhir_base_url`.
- **Selection**: picking a facility calls `FHIR.oauth2.authorize({ iss: <brand.fhir_base_url> })`.
  `fhir-client.js` discovers the authorize/token endpoints from
  `{iss}/.well-known/smart-configuration` - so JHE routes purely on the `iss`, never on
  hardcoded endpoints.

### Seeding + refreshing the brand list

`manage.py seed` loads a small curated sample
(`core/data/ehr_brands.sample.json`)
so the picker has data out of the box. For a full list, download a vendor's **user-access
Brands Bundle** and import it:

```bash
# Epic publishes ~94k organizations / ~800 endpoints:
curl -sSL -o epic_brands.json https://open.epic.com/MyApps/Endpoints
docker compose exec web python manage.py import_ehr_brands --file epic_brands.json
```

The importer is idempotent (brands keyed on `fhir_base_url`); re-run to refresh.

> **The full Epic file does not import yet.** Epic's bundle links its organizations to
> endpoints with `urn:uuid` references, which the importer does not resolve, so the command
> above completes with few or no locations. Use the shipped sample until that is fixed - see
> [Out of scope](#out-of-scope-follow-up).

### Extending to other EHR vendors

The importer parses any SMART user-access Brands Bundle, so **adding Cerner/Athena/etc. is
importing that vendor's bundle - no code change** for search or selection. The one future
code change for real multi-vendor auth is a **per-vendor `client_id`** (today the single EHR
`client_id` lives in the Patient Access client's `aux_data`). If CMS ships its planned national
brands directory, point the importer at that instead.

## Configuration

### EHR config (`JheClient.aux_data`)

The seeded **Patient Access** client carries the EHR config in its `aux_data` JSON blob. The
connect/callback views inject it into the page; `fhir-client.js` discovers the
authorize/token endpoints from `{iss}/.well-known/smart-configuration`.

```json
{
  "client_id": "<EHR non-production client id>",
  "scopes": "openid profile launch/patient patient/Patient.read patient/Observation.read patient/Condition.read patient/MedicationRequest.read patient/AllergyIntolerance.read"
}
```

> There is no `iss` in `aux_data`. The hospital the patient picks supplies it
> (`EhrBrand.fhir_base_url`) at authorize time, and the callback reads it back from the
> authorized server. Only `client_id` and `scopes` are configured.

### Register the EHR app (one-time, Epic example)

Each deploying institution registers its **own** app at [fhir.epic.com](https://fhir.epic.com);
the redirect URI and APIs live on the EHR app, not in JHE.

1. Sign in at [fhir.epic.com](https://fhir.epic.com), **Build Apps -> Create**. Audience
   **Patients**, **SMART on FHIR standalone** launch, public client (PKCE, no secret).
1. **Incoming APIs (R4)**: `Patient.Read`, `Observation.Search/Read`, `Condition.Search/Read`,
   `MedicationRequest.Search/Read`, `AllergyIntolerance.Search/Read`.
1. **Redirect URIs**: add, byte-for-byte, your **callback** URL per environment:
   - Local: `http://localhost:8001/clients/patient-access/callback`
   - Fly: `https://jhe.fly.dev/clients/patient-access/callback`
1. Save; copy the issued **non-production client id** into the JHE config below.

> Epic can take ~1-12h to sync a new redirect URI. A `redirect_uri` mismatch right after
> editing usually just means it hasn't propagated yet.

### Point JHE at your EHR app

```bash
docker compose exec web python manage.py shell -c "
from oauth2_provider.models import get_application_model as G
c = G().objects.get(name='Patient Access').jhe_client
c.aux_data['client_id'] = '<your EHR non-production client id>'
c.save()
"
```

The EHR's FHIR base URL is not configured here. It comes from the `EhrBrand` row the patient
picks, so import that vendor's brands bundle instead (see
[Seeding + refreshing the brand list](#seeding-refreshing-the-brand-list)).

## Local setup (Docker)

The default Compose stack serves `:8001` with `SITE_URL=http://localhost:8001`. The seed also
creates the **Patient Access API** `DataSource` (every `FhirSource` needs one), seeds the
sample hospital brands, and wires the Patient Access client to the example patient **Peter**
(`ll_patient_peter@example.com`), so the flow is testable out of the box.

```bash
cd jupyterhealth-exchange
docker compose up --build -d
# wait for the web container's migrate to finish, then seed a clean DB:
docker compose exec web python manage.py seed --flush-db
```

## Out of scope (follow-up)

- **Full Epic brands import**: Epic's file uses `urn:uuid` references; the importer resolves
  the sample's `Organization/<id>` style and needs a small tweak to resolve `urn:uuid` for the
  full 94k-entry file. Bulk insert for that volume is also a follow-up.
- Production (non-sandbox) EHR app and promotion.
- Per-vendor `client_id` for simultaneous multi-vendor auth; refresh-token handling.
